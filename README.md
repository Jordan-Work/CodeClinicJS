# Code Clinic: JavaScript
![Code Clinic: JavaScript](hero.png)
This is the repository for my course, [Code Clinic: JavaScript](http://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Code-Clinic-JavaScript/369707-2.html). The full course is available at [lynda.com](http://lynda.com).

## Course Description
Successful programmers know more than a computer language. They also know how to think about solving problems. They use "computational thinking": breaking a problem down into segments that lend themselves to technical solutions. Code Clinic is a series of ten courses where lynda.com authors solve the same problems using different programming languages. Here, Ray Villalobos works with JavaScript.

Ray introduces challenges and then provides an overview of his solutions in JavaScript. Challenges include topics such as statistical analysis, searching directories for images, and accessing peripheral devices.

Visit other courses in the series to see how to solve the exact same challenges in languages like C++, C#, Java, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, and Swift.
